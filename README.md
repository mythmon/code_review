I think one way a novice programmer can learn is to write something as best they can, and then have an experienced
programmer (or at least another set of eyes) comment on, edit, or rewrite that implementation.

This is a place for me to do that, share my results, and keep every thing straight.

If you are interested in having code reviewed, make a pull request adding a folder with your code in it. Please note a general idea of how the code works, and if there are any particular areas that you have questions about.

This is mainly for smallish bits of codes. A few files. Nothing too big or too hard to get going.

I mainly know Python and JavaScript (both browser JS and Node.js), but feel to make pull requests in any language.
